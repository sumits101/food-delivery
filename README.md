# React + Vite
Before building the Food Ordering Website using ReactJS, a few tools and packages must be 
installed and configured. Below is the step-by-step process followed:
1. Installing Node.js and npm 
Before anything, make sure Node.js (which includes npm) is installed on your system: 
• Download and install: 
Visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS version. 
• Check installation: 
node -v 
npm -v
2. Creating a New Project Using Vite

4. 4. Installing Tailwind CSS 
• Initialize your project using Node.js. 
• Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies. 
• Create a CSS file and add Tailwind directives (@tailwind base;, components;, 
utilities;). 
• Configure Tailwind by editing tailwind.config.js to include your content paths. 
• Build the Tailwind CSS file using the Tailwind CLI.
